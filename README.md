# A plugin to PyElastica for the simulation of HSA robots

This repository contains a plugin for  [PyElastica](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica) to simulate
robots based on Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA).
Elastica makes use of the Discrete Cosserat Rod Model (DCM) to simulate the behaviour of slender rods.
We model the HSA rods as Cosserat rods, but perform several modifications to the DCM to account for the auxetic behaviour of HSAs.
Namely, we couple twist strains to an adjustment of the rest length of the rod.
This will let the rod extend when torsional torques are applied to it.
Additionally, the axial stiffness of the rod is modelled to be a linear function of the twist strain to account for a proportional 
increase of the spring constant with increasing twist angles, as shown by Good et al. [[1]](#1) in their characterization 
of the mechanical properties of HSAs.
We refer to the [publication](##Citation) for more details.

Currently, we are able to simulate the behaviour of closed HSAs
(i.e. the printed length is equal to the minimum length). Adaptations would be necessary to accommodate the simulation of 
semi-closed and open HSAs. Specifically, this would include non-linear couplings between the twist strains 
and the material properties such as the axial stiffness.

At the moment, the plugin is only able to simulate the behaviour of a single-segment HSA robot.
This corresponds to a parallel arrangement of HSAs, where each HSA is connected to an electric actuator at its proximal end.
All HSA rods are attached at their distal end to a (circular) platform.
An extension to multi-segment HSA robots would require the implementation of different kinds of constraints,
joints, etc.

## Usage

We provide two simulators: `HsaRodSimulator` and `HsaRobotSim`` to simulate individual HSA rods and assembled 
HSA robots, respectively.

### HSA rod simulator

The `HsaRodSimulator` can be used to simulate the behaviour of individual HSAs.

```python
# import the simulator
from hsa_elastica.forcing import ProximalEndTorsion
from hsa_elastica.simulation import HsaRodSimulator

# define the rod parameters
rod_params = dict(
    name="HSA_ROD",
    outside_radius=25.4e-3 / 2,  # m
    wall_thickness=2.43e-3,  # m
    material_density=1.05e3,  # kg/m^3
    printed_length=100e-3,  # m
    elastic_modulus=1e7,  # Pa
    elastic_modulus_scale_factor=0e0,  # Pa / [rad / m]
    shear_modulus=8e5,  # Pa
    bend_rigidity=2e-2,  # [Nm/(rad/m)] = Nm^2/rad
    twist_rigidity=14e-3,  # [Nm/(rad/m)] = Nm^2/rad
    rest_lengths_scale_factor=1e-2,  # [1/(rad/m) = m / rad]
    translational_damping_constant=[8e3, 8e3, 1e4],
    rotational_damping_constant=[5e0, 5e0, 7e0],
    max_actuation_torque=500e-3,  # Nm
    num_elements=25,
)

# create the simulator (duration and time step in seconds)
# the fps parameter is used to control the frequency of storing 
# the state information of the simulator
sim = HsaRodSimulator(rod_params=rod_params, duration=10.0, dt=5e-5, fps=100)

# configure the simulator. 
# The twist of the distal end of the rod is automatically constrained
sim.configure(finalize=False)

# add ramp actuation torsional_torque
sim.add_forcing_to(sim.rod).using(
    ProximalEndTorsion,
    # 0.5 Nm at the end of the ramp
    torsional_torque=rod_params["max_actuation_torque"],
    ramp_up_time=1.0,  # 1 s ramp up time
)

# finalize the configuration of the simulator
sim.finalize()
# run the simulation
sim.run()

# array of shape (num_frames,), where num_frames is the 
# number of frames stored during the simulation
# num_frames = duration * fps
time = sim.diagnostic_data["time"]
# array of shape (num_frames, 3, num_elements + 1) 
# where num_elements is the number of links of the rod
position = sim.diagnostic_data["position"]
# array of shape (num_frames, num_elements - 1)
twist_angle = sim.diagnostic_data["twist_angle"]
# rest lengths of the rod of shape (num_frames, num_elements)
rest_lengths = sim.diagnostic_data["rest_lengths"]
# rotational strains of the rod of shape (num_frames, 3, num_elements-1)
kappa = sim.diagnostic_data["kappa"]
# linear strains of the rod of shape (num_frames, 3, num_elements)
sigma = sim.diagnostic_data["sigma"]
```

## Getting started

We provide several scripts in the `examples` folder to get you started with the plugin.

### Verification of rod simulator against experimental results by Good et al. [[1]](#1)

The command

```bash
python examples/hsa_rod/verification_sim_against_good_et_al/hsa_rod_steady_state_characterisation.py
```

simulates the steady-state behaviour of individual HSA rods to identify several mechanical characteristics such as 
holding torque, minimum energy length, spring constant, and blocked force (e.g. Figure 3 of the paper).
We have tuned the parameters of the simulator to match the experimental results of Good et al. [[1]](#1) as closely as 
possible.
Finally, we compare the results of the simulation with the experimental results to verify the steady-state behaviour of the
simulator. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
python examples/hsa_rod/verification_sim_against_good_et_al/plot_verification_sim_against_good_et_al.py
```

### Motion primitives of HSA robots

The typical motion primitives such as elongation, bending, and twisting can be simulated dynamically by running the 
script

```bash
python examples/hsa_robot/motion_primitives.py
```

Subsequently, the script

```bash
python examples/hsa_robot/motion_primitives_postprocessing.py
```

can be used to visualize and animate the simulation data as shown in Figure 2 of the paper.

### Generation of steady-state dataset

The command

```bash
python examples/hsa_robot/generate_steady_state_dataset.py
```

will generate a dataset of steady-state configurations of HSA robots. 
Namely, we explore configurations of the robot in its entire workspace, be it through the means of random sampling
or stepping through a specified grid.

In the paper, this steady-state dataset was used to fit the SPCS kinematic parametrization to the shape of the HSA rods
at steady-state and evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed shape. The results are reported in Figure 5 of the paper.
